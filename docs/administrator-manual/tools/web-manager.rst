Web Manager
===========

The Web-Manager is used to

* monitor ongoing and finished calculations
* monitor the infrastructure associated with this Manager instance (its Clusters and Nodes)
* upload and search for algorithms and data types
* fetch resources (Client-API, Routine-API, tools)

The Web-Manager currently doesn't support a comprehensive user management. For logging in you just have to define a username and click on *Continue*.
As the username in the Web-Manager is used for filtering the displayed calculations, it is important that you use the same username for logging in and starting new programs over the Client-API.
